# BookSearch - Apollo Refactor

  
  

  ## Description
  
  The goal for this project was to take an application with a RESTful API backend and convert it to use GraphQL. All CRUD functionality was replaced with GraphQL queries and mutations using Apollo. Apollo client was used on the React frontend to get data from the server. It uses a Mongo database to store data.
